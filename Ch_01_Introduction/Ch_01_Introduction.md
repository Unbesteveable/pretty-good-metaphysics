# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this book is to describe a model of reality that works pretty well.
The model integrates a variety of philosophical view points and offers explanations for our modern intellectual anxieties.

The name *Pretty Good Metaphysics (PGM)* was chosen because it promotes the model's inherent humility. An assertion of PGM is that descriptions of reality are most helpful when they're simplifications of reality. And since a simplification isn't perfect, PGM isn't meant to be perfect either. 

## Model description

![Figure 1 - Models are simplifications](tree.png?raw=true)

The image above shows a tree, a person, and the person's mental representation of the tree. The drawing is also a single continuous line where the tree, person, and mental image are different wrinkles on the same connected loop.  The wrinkles depicting our representations are much smaller and less complex than the wrinkles of that which they represent. This act of simplification, along with the act of self reflection, are the core properties of the model. 

What is not explained by the PGM model is how or why the wrinkles in our mind tend to emulate the wrinkles of nature. In other words, it is not explained why a wrinkle representing a tree appeared in our mind. The process of wrinkle formation is outside the scope of the model. We are thus left in a position like a chameleon noticing that the patterns on the outside of its skin have come to mimic its surrounding environment, and not knowing how or why it happened.
 
The PGM model does however offer an explanation for why we don't understand the wrinkle formation process. The reason is that the wrinkles not only make simplifications of what's outside of us, but also what's inside. We make simplified representations of our subconscious, and those representations are not sufficiently detailed to understand exactly the operations of our lower level perceptions.
