# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this book is to describe a model of reality that works pretty well.
The model integrates a variety of philosophical view points and provides explanations for modern dilemnas. 

The name *Pretty Good Metaphysics (PGM)* was given to promote the model's inherent humility. An assertion of PGM is that descriptions of reality are most helpful when they're simplifications of reality. And since a simplification isn't perfect, PGM isn't meant to be perfect either. 

## Model description

An illustration of the PGM model is on the cover of the book. It shows a tree, a person, and the person's mental representation of the tree. Most importantly, the drawing is a single continuous line with the tree, person, and mental image all on the same connected loop.  The wrinkles depicting our representations are much smaller and less complex than the wrinkles of greater reality. This act of simplification, along with the act of self reflection, produce most of the consequences of using the model.

The PGM model does not explain how or why the wrinkles in our mind emulate the wrinkles of nature. The process of wrinkle formation is outside the scope of the model. We are thus left in a position like a chameleon noticing that the patterns on the outside of its skin have come to mimic its surrounding environment, and not knowing how it happened.
 
The model does however offer an explanation for why we don't understand the wrinkle formation process. The reason is that the wrinkles not only make simplifications of what's outside of us, but also what's inside of us. We make simplified representations of our subconscious, and those representations are not sufficiently detailed to understand exactly the operations of our lower level perceptions. 

%The PGM model places reality, as well as our conceptions of it, as one connected entity. However this is not meant to have revealed a metaphysical truth of reality. It's meant to be used as a model.
